This is an end-to-end data modeling project that entails designing and implementing a data warehouse solution for a music streaming industry. The core responsibility is to model an analytical database for the data analytics team that is particularly interested in understanding users' activity to improve business decisions. The current data available is operational data, JSON metadata files on the songs in the app.

# âœ… Project Objective
The project objective includes
1. The design of an optimized **data ingestion pipeline architecture** 
2. The design of the data warehouse **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** for the data analytics team 
3. **The implementation of Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL)**
4. The **Automation and Scheduling** of the processes

# About Nigeria HFR
The Nigeria Health Facility Registry (HFR) was developed in 2017 as part of effort to dynamically manage the Master Health Facility List (MFL) in the country. The MFL "is a complete listing of health facilities in a country (both public and private) and is comprised of a set of identification items for each facility (signature domain) and basic information on the service capacity of each facility (service domain)".

The Federal Ministry of Health had previously identified the need for an information system to manage the MFL in light of different shortcomings encountered in maintaining an up-to-date paper based MFL. The benefits of the HFR are numerous including serving as the hub for connecting different information systems thereby enabling integration and interoperability, eliminating duplication of health facility lists and for planning the establishment of new health facilities.

# Project Development

## Data Ingestion Pipeline Architecture
This design has been made using  https://www.app.diagrams.net/ .

![Dele_HFR_architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58152694/179662268-03a5b394-9618-4262-a84e-73795e39f160.png)

The architecture is showing my choice of tools and framework for each processes of the data warehousing project.
* The data source as provided remains the HFR website (https://bit.ly/3lVu5C6) 
* The Data Extraction shall be carried out by utilizing the **Selenium Python web automation framework**. 
* Data Transformation using the Python Big Data manipulation Framework - **PySpark** 
* The workflow management or orchestration tool of choice for the Scheduling and Automation is the **Airflow**
* And as this is a prototype, the **Postgres Database** shall be used for the final data warehouse while the jupyter notebook with python or any other analytical tools would be used to analyse the data for answers

## ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram) Design
The ERD  of the system as shown below can also be accessed here https://lucid.app/lucidchart/3b297f6f-6dd4-40b4-805c-263f42043573/edit?invitationId=inv_c95a73c5-49bf-464c-845e-37e7e9b6ba7e#

From considering the HFR requirements and studying the value types and forms of data available on the HFR website:
* I have designed a **Star schema** as my final data mart showing six (6) dimension tables.Having performed 3 levels of normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) where applicable.
* The model has also been designed to provide information for all possible grains. i.e the fact table rows  provide a high level of details.
* This stage I would say has been the most tasking.
  
## Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) Implementaion
